<h2>Daily Place That Price Challenge</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Daily Place That Price Challenge! Each day, we generate three exciting types of real estate games for you: 3, 5, and 10 homes to test your property valuation skills. Get ready for the challenge!</p>

<h2>How It Works:</h2>

<p>Our daily challenge presents you with a selection of homes. The catch? Once you start a home, you must complete itâ€”there's no turning back! If you leave it unfinished, you lose it forever. The clock is ticking, and it's your chance to prove your property valuation prowess.</p>

<h2>Your Daily Quest:</h2>

<p>Every day, your goal is to complete all the homes assigned for that day. Each home will challenge your ability to estimate its value. The closer your estimate is to the actual price, the better your chances of success.</p>

<p>After you've valiantly completed all the homes for the day, you'll be rewarded with a color:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Red:</strong> You will do better next time.</li>
	<li><strong>Yellow:</strong> You're doing well. Your accuracy is right on target.</li>
	<li><strong>Green:</strong> Amazing job! You've demonstrated top-notch valuation skills.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenge Friends and Family:</h2>

<p>While there's no formal scoreboard, you can now challenge your friends and family. Compare your results and see who has the sharpest property valuation skills.</p>

<h2>Take Breaks, Pick Up Where You Left Off:</h2>

<p>We understand that life can be busy. Feel free to take breaks between rounds. Our system will remember your progress and allow you to pick up right where you left off.</p>

<p>Ready for the daily adventure? It's time to dive into the world of property valuation challenges!</p>
